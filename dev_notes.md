I started this project 2 months ago, but didn't document how I began. So I am picking it up here. I am going to start by making sure I can spin up a working vue + typescript application.

Some resources that I'm looking at:
- [vue with typescript](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-write-a-vue-js-app-completely-in-typescript/)
- [Using typescript with vue](https://alligator.io/vuejs/using-typescript-with-vue/)
- and of course the [vue.js website](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html)

My goal is to build the Vue.js from scratch, and use a bundler like webpack 4 or something else.
