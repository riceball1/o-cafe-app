# O Cafe App

The O Cafe app is an app that allows customers to order different cafe drinks and customize. Offering a simplistic, smooth frictionless user-interface. I am using this app to apply parcel js bundler and use the vue.js framework. I work mainly with React, but wanted to test out vue.js to get a sense of another framework's mentality. For the first version of this app I will also use a [json server](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/create-a-rest-api-with-json-server-36da8680136d).
