# O Cafe App

The O Cafe app is an app that allows customers to customize and order different cafe drinks. The app offers a simplistic, smooth frictionless user-interface. I am using this project to work on building my experience with Vue.js. I work mainly with React, but wanted to test out vue.js to get a sense of another framework's mentality. For the first version of this app I will also use [json server](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/create-a-rest-api-with-json-server-36da8680136d), but in later versions I will upgrade to a proper backend.
